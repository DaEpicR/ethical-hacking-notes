## Data Exfiltration

```markdown
1. In which case scenario will sending and receiving traffic continue during the connection?

2. In which case scenario will sending and receiving traffic be in one direction?
```

## Exfiltration using TCP socket

```markdown
1. Exfiltration using TCP sockets relies on ____________ protocols! 
```

## Exfiltration using SSH

```markdown
1. All packets sent using the Data Exfiltration technique over SSH are encrypted?
```

## Exfiltrate using HTTP(S)

```markdown
1. Check the Apache log file on web.thm.com  and get the flag!

2. When you visit the http://flag.thm.com/flag website through the uploader machine via the HTTP tunneling technique, what is the flag?
```

## Exfiltration using ICMP

```markdown
1. In which ICMP packet section can we include our data?

2. Follow the technique discussed in this task to establish a C2 ICMP connection between JumpBox and ICMP-Host. Then execute the "getFlag" command. What is the flag?
```

## DNS Configurations

```markdown
1. Once the DNS configuration works fine, resolve the flag.thm.com  domain name. What is the IP address?
```

## Exfiltration over DNS

```markdown
1. What is the maximum length for the subdomain name (label)?

2. The Fully Qualified FQDN domain name must not exceed ______ characters.

3. Execute the C2 communication over the DNS protocol of the flag.tunnel.com. What is the flag?
```

## DNS Tunneling

```markdown
1. When the iodine connection establishes to Attacker, run the ifconfig command. How many interfaces are there?

2. What is the network interface name created by iodined?

3. Use the DNS tunneling to prove your access to the webserver, http://192.168.0.100/test.php . What is the flag?
```
