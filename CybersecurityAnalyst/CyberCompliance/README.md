## Compliance Frameworks and Industry Standards

* Security - designed protection from theft/damage, disruption or misdirection; physical, technical and operational controls.

* Privacy - based on how info is used/shared.

* Compliance - tests if security measures are in place; covers non-security requirements as well.

* Compliance types:

  * Foundational - general specifications; important but not legally required (e.g. - SOC, ISO).

  * Industry - specific to an industry; legal requirements (e.g. - HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

* General compliance process phases:

  * Establish scope
  * Readiness assessment
  * Gap remediation
  * Testing/Auditing
  * Management assertion & reporting
  * Re-Certify

* GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):

  * Rights of EU Data Subjects
  * Security of Personal Data
  * Consent
  * Accountability of Compliance
  * Data Protection by Design and by Default

* ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 2700x - family of standards to help organizations keep info assets secure.

* HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) - US Federal laws and regulations that define control of most personal healthcare information (PHI) for companies responsible for managing such data.

* PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) - applies to all entities that store, process and/or transmit cardholder data; covers technical and operational practices for system components.

* CIS (Center for Internet Security) Critical Security Controls - prioritized set of actions and best-practices that mitigate common attacks against systems & networks; includes basic, foundational and organizational control.
