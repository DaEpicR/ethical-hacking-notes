## Threat Intelligence

* Threat intelligence - info about threats & threat actors that helps mitigate incidents.

* Threat intelligence strategy:

  * Collect - integrate data
  
  * Process - put data in context

  * Analyze - find insight & actions

  * Share - inform decisions

* Intelligence areas - Tactical, Operational, Strategic

* Threat intelligence platform capabilities:

  * Collect
  * Correlate
  * Enrichment & Contextualization
  * Analyze
  * Integrate
  * Act

* Best practices - Intelligence detection:

  * Predict & prioritize security weaknesses
  * Detect deviations to identify malicious activity
  * React in real time to exploits

* Security intelligence - real-time collection, normalization & analytics of data generated by users, apps & infra that impacts IT security & risk posture of an organization.

## Data Loss Prevention and Mobile Endpoint Protection

* Top challenges for data security:

  * Explosive data growth
  * New privacy regulations
  * Operational complexity
  * Cybersecurity skills shortage

* Common pitfalls in data security:

  * Failure to move beyond compliance
  * Failure to recognize need for centralized data security
  * Failure to define who owns responsibility for data
  * Failure to adddress known vulnerabilities
  * Failure to prioritize & leverage data activity monitoring

* Data protection capabilities:

  * Data discovery
  * Data classification
  * Vulnerability assessment
  * Data risk analysis
  * Data & file activity monitoring
  * Real-time alerting
  * Blocking, masking & quarantining
  * Active analytics
  * Encryption
  * Tokenization
  * Key management
  * Automated compliance report

* Mobile endpoints differ from traditional endpoints in the following manner:

  * Users don't interact directly with OS
  * Apps act as broker between user and OS
  * OS stability can be easily monitored
  * AV software can check apps and read certain signatures, but cannot peek inside the app contents

* Daily operations in mobile endpoint protection:

  * Monitor device OS versions
  * Monitor app installs and versions
  * Monitor & enforce encryption
  * Distribute secure payloads
  * Automate compliance actions
  * Ensure proper NAC policies are enforced
  * Educate users regularly
  * Update contingency plans
