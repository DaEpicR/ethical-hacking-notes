## People Process & Technology

* IT Security - protection of computer systems from theft/damage to hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption of services provided.

* Security standards and compliance:

  * Best practices, baselines and frameworks
  * Normative and compliance

* Roles in information security:

  * CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)
  * Information Security Architect
  * Information Security Consultant
  * Information Security Analyst
  * Information Security Auditor
  * Security Software Developer
  * Penetration Tester

* Security Operations Centers (SOC) need to have current skills, tools and processes for detecting, investigating and stopping threats.

* Process - set of defined steps that take inputs, add value, and produce outputs that satisfy a customer's requirements.

* Attributes of a process:

  * Inputs
  * Outputs
  * Scope
  * Tasks

* CPI (Continual Process Improvement) - regular review of:

  * Process metrics
  * Customer feedback
  * Maturity assessments
  * Financial performance

* ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) - best practice framework describing how IT resources should be organized to deliver business value.

* ITIL service lifecycle phases:

  * Strategy
  * Design
  * Transition
  * Operations
  * Improvement

* Key ITIL processes:

  * Problem Management
  * Change Management
  * Incident Management
  * Event Management
  * Service Level Management
  * Information Security Management

## Examples & Princples of the CIA Triad

* Key objectives of network security:

  * Confidentiality
  * Integrity
  * Availability
  * Authenticity
  * Accountability

## Authentication and Access Control

* Identification and AAA - Authentication, Authorization, Accountability

* Control types - Administrative, Technical and Physical

* Each control type can be:

  * Corrective
  * Preventive
  * Dissuasive
  * Recovery
  * Detective
  * Compensatory

* Access control models:

  * MAC (Mandatory Access Control) - use labels to regulate access; military use.

  * DAC (Discretionary Access Control) - each object (file/folder) has an owner, who defines the privilege.

  * RBAC (Role Based Access Control) - rights configured based on user roles.

  * Centralized - SSO (Single Sign on); AAA.

  * Decentralized - independent access control methods; local power.

* Best practices for access control:

  * Least privilege
  * Separation of duties
  * Rotation of duties

* Physical access control methods:

  * Perimetral
  * Building
  * Work areas
  * Servers and networks

* Monitoring the access control process:

  * IDS
  * IPS
  * Host IDS and IPS
  * HoneyPot
  * Sniffers
