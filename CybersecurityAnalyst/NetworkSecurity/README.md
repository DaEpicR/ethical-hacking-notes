## TCP/IP Framework

* IDS (Intrusion Detection System) - network security tech built for detecting vulnerability exploits against the system; listen-only device as it monitors traffic and reports results to administrator.

* IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) - network security and threat prevention tech that examines network traffic flows to detect & prevent vulnerability exploits; it is placed inline (unlike IDS), behind firewall, and in direct communication path for active prevention.

* Threat detection types:

  * Signature-based
  * Anomaly-based
  * Host-based
  * Network-based

* NAT (Network Address Translation) - remapping one IP address space into another for security.

* Types of NAT:

  * Static - one-to-one mapping between local & global addresses.

  * Dynamic - maps unregistered IP addresses to registered IP addresses from a pool.

  * Overloading - maps multiple unregistered IP addresses to a single registered IP address, many-to-one, using different ports; also known as Port Address Translation.

* ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - process of using layer 3 addresses (IP address) to determine layer 2 addresses (MAC address).
