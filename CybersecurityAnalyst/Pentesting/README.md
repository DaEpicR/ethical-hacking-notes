## Penetration Testing

* Approaches to pentesting:

  * Internal, external
  * Web, mobile app assessments
  * Social engineering
  * Wireless networks, embedded devices, IoT
  * ICS (Industry Control Systems) pentesting

* Phases:

  * Planning
  * Discovery
  * Attack
  * Report

## Incident Response

* Incident response - detection of incidents to minimize loss, mitigate exploits and restore services.

* IR team models:

  * Central
  * Distributed
  * Coordinating

* IR phases:

  * Preparation
  * Detection & Analysis
  * Containment, Eradication & Recovery
  * Post-incident activity

## Digital Forensics

* Digital forensics - identification, collection, examination & analysis of data while preserving its integrity and maintaining a chain of custody.

* Forensic process

  * Collection
  * Examination
  * Analysis
  * Reporting

## Introduction to Scripting

* Scripts - small interpreted programs for purposes such as automation, testing, etc.

* Common scripting languages include Javascript, Bash, Perl, PowerShell, Binary and Hex.
