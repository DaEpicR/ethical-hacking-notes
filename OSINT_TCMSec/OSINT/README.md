## Search Engine OSINT

* We can use multiple search engines, such as [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) to conduct OSINT.

* We can use advanced search techniques for these search engines:

  * [Google](https://www.googleguide.com/print/adv_op_ref.pdf)
  * [Bing](https://www.bruceclay.com/blog/bing-google-advanced-search-operators/)
  * [DuckDuckGo](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/)

* For example, we can search for subdomains on Google:

  ```site:tesla.com -www```

## Image OSINT

* We can reverse-search images using platforms such as:

  * [Google Image Search](https://images.google.com/)
  * [Yandex](https://yandex.com/)
  * [TinEye](https://tineye.com)
  * [DupliChecker](https://www.duplichecker.com/reverse-image-search.php)

* We can use websites to view EXIF data or metadata; alternatively we can use tools such as ```exiftool```.

* For physical location OSINT, we can use Google Map's features such as 'satellite view' and 'street view', and check the location surroundings.
