# Introduction

* Basic commands:

  * ```whoami``` - prints username

  * ```hostname``` - prints name of host

  * ```pwd``` - prints current working directory

  * ```ls``` - list contents of directory

  * ```cd``` - change directory

  * ```man <command>``` - manual page for any command

  * ```info <command>``` - alternative to ```man```

* Resources such as [Explainshell](https://explainshell.com/) can be used to understand commands.

* Commands will also have arguments and options; we can combine multiple single-character options.

* Text file contents can be viewed using basic programs like ```more```, ```less``` and ```cat```.

* ```cat``` can be used to concatenate files as well; for example, ```cat file1.txt file2.txt``` will print contents of both files.

* If we run ```cat``` without a filename, it echoes whatever we type.

* ```cat``` can be used with redirectional operators as well; for example ```cat file1.txt file3.txt > combined.txt``` redirects the output to 'combined.txt' file.
