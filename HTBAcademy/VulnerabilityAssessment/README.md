## Security Assessments

* Vulnerability assessments - compliance, based on particular security standards, is analyzed. For organizations with lower security maturity level.

* Penetration tests - simulated cyber attack; on the basis of info given to testers, pentests can be categorized as black box, grey box or white box; on the basis of tech, pentests can be on the basis of application, network/infrastructure, physical or social engineering. For organizations with medium/high security maturity level.

* Security audits - requirements by government or industry associations to assure organization is compliant with specific regulations.

* Bug bounties - public members attempt to find security vulnerabilities in companies' apps.

* Team assessments - could be red team, blue team or purple team; campaigns simulating cyber attacks, with each team having different objectives.

## Vulnerability Assessments

* Vulnerability assessments aim to identify, categorize and provide remediation steps for security risks; there is little to no manual exploitation.

* Methodology:

  * Conduct risk identification & analysis
  * Develop vulnerability scanning policies
  * Identify type of scans
  * Configure scan
  * Perform scan
  * Evaluate & consider possible risks
  * Interpret scan results
  * Create remediation & mitigation plan

* As a part of vulnerability management, organizations should have an asset inventory to understand what assets are in its network, so that asset management can be done properly.

* Compliance standards examples - PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FISMA and ISO 27001.

* Pentesting standards examples - PTES, OSSTMM, NIST and OWASP.

## Vulnerability Scoring & Reporting

* CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):

  * System used to categorize risk associated with an issue; allows to prioritize issues based on rating.

  * Often used with another risk assessment system, Microsoft DREAD - Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.

  * CVSS scoring consists of exploitability (based on attack) & impact (based on CIA triad) of an issue.

* CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):

  * OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language) - publicly available standard, used to evaluate the system's current state and issues.
  
  * OVAL definitions are recorded in an XML format to discover vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, programs and other system info, taking out the need to exploit a system.

  * CVE - public catalog of security issues with unique CVE IDs.

  * A CVE consists of critical info regarding a vulnerability or exposure - allows to understand how much impact a problem can have.

* ```Nessus``` & ```OpenVAS``` are two popular vulnerability scanners with various functionalities.
